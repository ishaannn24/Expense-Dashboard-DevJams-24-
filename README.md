Xpense is a website which tracks your daily spendings and logs it in a single place so you donâ€™t have to switch between various apps. Xpense tracks all UPI, credit/debit card and bank payments at no extra charge. The website uses Twilio API to read the notifications which resemble a spending. It breaks down your daily spending into categories, and offers guidance to help you understand where your money is going and how to budget. It also allows you to set monthly spending limits apart from providing monthly report inclusive of trends and analytics. All of this, while ensuring data encryption for financial security.
The website uses front end framework called bootstrap apart from SpringBoot and MySQL for backend. We have also used figma for the UI/UX designs.
